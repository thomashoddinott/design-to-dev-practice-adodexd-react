# Design to Dev Practice with AdobeXD and React

I'm going to use React to implement a design that I created in AdobeXD.

**React implementation: https://thomashoddinott.github.io/design-to-dev-practice-adodexd-react/**

Nothing complex going on with React here. This was mostly an exercise in CSS. I also spent a while manipulating SVG graphics. 

Basic responsiveness (browser zoom in/out) *but still needs some work on browser window resize.*
